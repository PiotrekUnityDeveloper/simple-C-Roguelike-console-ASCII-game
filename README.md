# simple-C-Roguelike-console-ASCII-game
my old abandoned project that is free to use

the code is a fckin mess, sorry about that.

Stuff implemented:
- main menu (arrows to switch selection, enter to select)
- customizable board
- player movement: W, A, S, D
- spawn a wall 1 tile above the player by pressing SPACE
- spawn an enemy 2 tiles above the player by pressing 'N'
- test the raytracing algorithm by pressing 'M' (enable visualization)
- enemy AI is a bit odd. He randomly picks X or Y prioritizement and moves in the player direction in that axis (tried to make him see you from max 2 tiles, and the code it there but it doesnt work)
- most stuff contoller by vars (ide dev)
- ease of implementing settings (ez2 set variables that does smth idk checkitby urself)

anyways, thanks and enjoy!
